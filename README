This directory contains code and related resources for using HTK to do
speech activity detection (SAD). 

Apart from model data, it contains two executable scripts, each of which
is discussed in turn:

   perform_sad.py
   htk_2_sec.py


I. perform_sad.py
-----------------
This performs SAD for a series of 16 KHz single-channel wave files.
The files may be specified individually on the command line or via
a script file, each line of which contains the path to a single wav
file to be processed. For each wav file a label file is produced with
one line per segment detected in the following format:

ONSET OFFSET LAB

where ONSET and OFFSET are the onset and offset of the segment in 
HTK 100 ns units and LAB is one of {spch, nonspch}.

The minimum durations for speech and non-speech segments, the output
directory, and the number of threads to use during SAD are all
customizable via flags. Run ./perform_sad.py without any arguments
to see example usage and help.


II. htk_2_sec.py
----------------
This is a convenience script to convert the output of perform_sad.py
from htk units to seconds. Its usage should be self-explanatory, but
run ./htk_2_sec.py without any arguments for help.
